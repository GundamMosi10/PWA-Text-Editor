## Installation:
Once you have the code on your computer you can open an integrated terminal and run the codes: npm i, npm install, npm run build, and npm run start:dev, these will start the server and will be listening on PORT:3000. Now when you open a Google Chrome browser on localhost:3000 you will see the application. 
Another way to look at this application will be with the deployed link with Heroku.
